We have seen how We can automate the build and deploy of an application by using pipelines integration in our buildconfigs. In the previous example We deployed the application in multiple environments but the actual production environment was unique, so if we end up deploying an application that is broken for whatever reason we could affect the service.

You might remember that we already talked about deployment strategies (a method of changing or upgrading an application) when review how deploymentconfigs rollout the PODs when a new version is released (types are `rolling`, `recreate` and `custom`), but those ones just protect against deployment or POD readiness failures, What happens if the service works but not in the ways that it is suppose to do?. We can reduce risk if we apply any of the advanced deployment strategies.


## Background: Advanced Deployment strategies in Openshift routers

Advanced Deployment strategies that use the OpenShift router features are listed below:


* A/B Deployment: The A/B deployment strategy allows you to deploy a new version of the application for a limited set of users in the production environment. You can configure OpenShift so that it routes the majority of requests to the currently deployed version in a production environment, while a limited number of requests go to the new version.
By controlling the portion of requests sent to each version as testing progresses, you can gradually increase the number of requests sent to the new version. Eventually, you can stop routing traffic to the previous version. As you adjust the request load on each version, the number of pods in each service may need to be scaled to provide the expected performance.


* Blue-Green Deployment: In Blue-Green deployments, you have two identical environments running concurrently, where each environment runs a different version of the application. The OpenShift router is used to direct traffic from the current in-production version (Green) to the newer updated version (Blue). You can implement this strategy using a route and two services. Define a service for each specific version of the application. The route points to one of the services at any given time, and can be changed to point to a different service when ready, or to facilitate a rollback. As a developer, you can test the new version of your application by connecting to the new service before routing your production traffic to it. When your new application version is ready for production, change the production router to point to the new service defined for your updated application. 
When you deploy the new version of the application in production, you deploy into the inactive environment, green in this example, and after ensuring that the new version works correctly in production you switch the router so that all incoming production traffic goes to the green environment, making the blue one idle. 
Blue-green deployment also enables you to be able to quickly rollback to the previous version. if anything goes wrong with the new version after the switch, you can switch back the router the blue version. You still need to manage transactions and database changes when deploying new versions of your application however there are other patterns to specifically deal with those issues separately for example depending on your environment and application design, you might be able to feed transactions to both environments so that the blue environment acts as a backup or run the application in read-only mode before doing a switch.





OpenShift `router` objects have capabilities to implement those advanced deployment strategies, so you don't need to work on external scripts to make it possible. You can use those techniques by deploying manually your application but it make more sense if you integrate it in your CI/CD pipeline. Those capabilities can be used in either manual deployments or when integrated with Jenkins because although Jenkins can perform this kind of deployment in other ways, it is a good idea to use the router capabilities when deploying on OpenShift.

This OpenShift `router` capabilities are a key differenciator against Kubernetes ingress controllers, but if your needs are not covered by them, you can explore the use of the OpenShift link:https://blog.openshift.com/red-hat-openshift-service-mesh-is-now-available-what-you-should-know/[Service Mesh] service, that will enable avanced control of traffic along with other security capabilities. You can review some example in the link:https://istio.io/docs/tasks/[Task section in the ISTIO Documentation] (OpenShift Service Mesh is based on ISTIO)


Let's explore these advanced deployement strategies



## A/B Deployment 

With AB Testing you can introduce a new version of application and split traffic to the new version gradually instead of suddenly switching from one version to another.

To test it We will deploy two versions of the same application (app-a and app-b). Then we will configure the route in such a way that the traffic initially would be going to first version (app-a) and then we will gradually shift traffic from app-a to app-b.


### Deploy app-a

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc new-app --image-stream=php --code=https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/ab-deploy  --name=app-a
----

Create a route and name it abtest

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc expose service app-a --name=abtest
----

Verify the route created and note the URL

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get route
----

Wait until build completes by watching build logs

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc logs builds/app-a-1
----

Ensure app is deployed

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get po
----

Test the app


[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
{% raw %}curl $(oc get route abtest --template={{.spec.host}}){% endraw %}
----

This shows `I am VERSION 1` as the output.

Let us run curl 20 times


[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
{% raw %}for i in {1..20}; do curl -w "\n" $(oc get route abtest --template={{.spec.host}}); done{% endraw %}
----

It always hits version 1.

Output example:

----
{% raw %}$ for i in {1..20}; do curl -w "\n" $(oc get route abtest --template={{.spec.host}}); done
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133{% endraw %}
----



### Deploy app-b

We have a separate branch v2. Same exact app with a small change. This will be named app-b

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc new-app --image-stream=php --code=https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/ab-deploy#v2  --name=app-b
----

Watch and Wait until build completes

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc logs builds/app-b-1 -f
----

Note the service created is also called app-b

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get svc
----


### Introducing app-b as Canary


Now we will do AB testing by splitting traffic between services app-a and app-b. We want to send a small amount of traffic to app-b.

Look at the backends for our route abtest


[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc set route-backends abtest
----

Output example:

----
$ oc set route-backends abtest
NAME           KIND     TO     WEIGHT
routes/abtest  Service  app-a  100
----

You can see that all the traffic going to service`app-a`

Let us send 10% of traffic to service app-b, so that it acts as a canary receiving 1 out of 10 requests


[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc set route-backends abtest app-a=9 app-b=1
----


Verify the setting now

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc set route-backends abtest
----

Output example:

----
$ oc set route-backends abtest
NAME           KIND     TO     WEIGHT
routes/abtest  Service  app-a  9 (90%)
routes/abtest  Service  app-b  1 (10%)
----


It shows that the traffic is now split between services app-a and app-b in the ratio of 90% and 10%.

Test the app now

Let us again run curl 20 times 


[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
{% raw %}for i in {1..20}; do curl -w "\n" $(oc get route abtest --template={{.spec.host}}); done{% endraw %}
----

Youâ€™ll see out of every 10 requests 9 go to service app-a and 1 goes to service app-b

----
{% raw %}$ for i in {1..20}; do curl -w "\n" $(oc get route abtest --template={{.spec.host}}); done
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133{% endraw %}
----

This is the behavior of a canary.

Canary is used to test to test waters; to make sure there are no issues.

Let us say app-b canary is gone well and we want to gradually increase the amount of traffic to this new version.



### Adjust the traffic split percentages

Let us make it 50-50 split this time


[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc set route-backends abtest --adjust app-b=50%
----


and verify the change to note 50-50 split

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc set route-backends abtest
----

Ouput:

----
$ oc set route-backends abtest
NAME           KIND     TO     WEIGHT
routes/abtest  Service  app-a  50 (50%)
routes/abtest  Service  app-b  50 (50%)
----

Test again and note the traffic is evenly distributed between the two versions



[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
{% raw %}for i in {1..20}; do curl -w "\n" $(oc get route abtest --template={{.spec.host}}); done{% endraw %}
----

----
{% raw %}$ for i in {1..20}; do curl -w "\n" $(oc get route abtest --template={{.spec.host}}); done
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 1 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.133
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134{% endraw %}
----



### Shift to new version

Let us completely shift to the new version

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc set route-backends abtest --adjust app-b=100%
----



[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc set route-backends abtest
----

Ouput:

----
$ oc set route-backends abtest
NAME           KIND     TO     WEIGHT
routes/abtest  Service  app-a  0 (0%)
routes/abtest  Service  app-b  100 (100%)
----

Test again


[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
{% raw %}for i in {1..20}; do curl -w "\n" $(oc get route abtest --template={{.spec.host}}); done{% endraw %}
----

Notice that all the traffic is now hitting the new version.

----
{% raw %} $ for i in {1..20}; do curl -w "\n" $(oc get route abtest --template={{.spec.host}}); done
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134
 I am VERSION 2 <br><br>My Pod IP is : 10.130.0.134

## Blue-Green Deployment

In order to show Blue-Green deployments we are going to deploy two versions of the same application. The first version will display a blue rectangle and the second one a green rectable. We will create an OpenShift route (a FQDN) that can be used to expose the applications. We will first expose the version 1, the blue version, at some point in time, We will then switch OpenShift route from the first application (blue) to the second application (green).



### Deploy Blue Version and Test

Deploy the blue version of the application


[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc new-app --image-stream=php --code=https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/bluegreen#blue  --name=blue
----

Monitor the application build

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get builds
----


Using the build name of the recently created application run:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc logs build/blue-1
----


Once build is successful, you will see running pods.

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods
----

Notice that the build pod has exited and you now have a single instance of the application running under one single pod.

List the service

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get service
----

Expose the service

[NOTE]
While we are exposing the blue service, we are actually naming the route as bluegreen as we are going to do bluegreen deployments with the same route instance.

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc expose service blue --name=bluegreen
----

Look at the route that got created now

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get route
----

It should look something like this

----
$ oc get route
NAME        HOST/PORT                                              PATH   SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION  WILDCARD
bluegreen   bluegreen-bluegreen-user1.apps.first.40.ocpcloud.com          blue       8080-tcp  None
----

Now test the application by copying your Route URL in the browser. You should see something similar to:

http://bluegreen-lab-intro-{{ username }}.{{ cluster_subdomain }}


image::../images/bluegreen1.png[]


At this point you have deployed an application that displays for illustration purposes a blue rectangle for version 1.




### Deploy Green Version

What We will do now is to deploy a new version of this application (Same one as before with a very small change) and then to point the previously created FQDN (route) to the new service that will be created as part of the new application creation process.

Let us deploy new green version of the application in the same way we did blue version. Make sure to name the application as `green' this time.



[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc new-app --image-stream=php --code=https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/bluegreen#green --name=green
----

Wait until the application is built and deployed. 

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pod
----



You should now see two services if you run:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get svc
----

----
$ oc get svc
NAME    TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
blue    ClusterIP   172.30.240.196   <none>        8080/TCP,8443/TCP   15m
green   ClusterIP   172.30.128.91    <none>        8080/TCP,8443/TCP   12s
----



### Switching from Blue to Green

Check the route again and note that it is still pointing to blue service.

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get route
----

----
$ oc get routes
NAME        HOST/PORT                                              PATH   SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
bluegreen   bluegreen-bluegreen-user1.apps.first.40.ocpcloud.com          blue       8080-tcp   None
----

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc set route-backends bluegreen
----

----
$ oc set route-backends bluegreen
NAME              KIND     TO    WEIGHT
routes/bluegreen  Service  blue  100
----

The command `oc set route-backends` will show how the traffic is flowing from the route to the backend service.

Now let us change the route to send all the traffic to green by running

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc set route-backends bluegreen green=100
----

So by doing this we updated the route named `bluegreen` to send all the traffic to green service backend.

You can confirm the change is made in two ways


[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc set route-backends bluegreen
----

----
$ oc set route-backends bluegreen
NAME              KIND     TO     WEIGHT
routes/bluegreen  Service  green  100
----


[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get route bluegreen
----

----
$ oc get route bluegreen
NAME        HOST/PORT                                              PATH   SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
bluegreen   bluegreen-bluegreen-user1.apps.first.40.ocpcloud.com          green      8080-tcp   None
----

Let us test the application by using th same route in the browser

You should now see the new version of the recently deployed application with a green rectangle as below.


http://bluegreen-lab-intro-{{ username }}.{{ cluster_subdomain }}

## Clean the environment

Delete all objects to start the next section with a clean project 

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc delete all --all
----
