Before we get started, be sure that you are in the right project in the CLI:

```execute
oc project lab-intro-{{ username }}
```

We are not going to use the web console for this section, but if you want to check anything from the web console, switch to the **Console** and  use the same credentials to login as you used above to login from the command line.
